# Flight-Delay-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict flight delays and compare their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
# Objectives
#### Flight Delay Prediction: 
Build models that can predict whether a flight will be delayed based on factors like weather conditions, airline information, time of departure, and historical delay data.
#### Algorithm Comparison: 
Evaluate and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest, to determine the most effective model for prediction.
# Workflow
#### Data Collection:
Collect datasets containing historical flight data, weather data, and airport information. This data can include features such as:
Flight number
Departure and arrival airports
Scheduled and actual departure/arrival times
Weather conditions
Airline information
Delay status (binary: delayed or not delayed).
#### Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values.
Perform feature selection and engineering (e.g., extract useful information like peak hours or seasonal trends).
Normalize or scale numerical data if necessary.
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyze the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and correlations.
Visualize relationships between variables using graphs and charts.
#### Model Implementation:

##### Train multiple machine learning models:
Logistic Regression: For binary classification based on linear relationships.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): To classify data points based on proximity to neighbors.

Decision Tree: For rule-based classification.

Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model assuming feature independence.

Random Forest: An ensemble learning method based on decision trees.

Tune hyperparameters of each model to optimize performance.
#### Model Evaluation:
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate each model's performance.
Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness and reliability.
#### Comparison and Results:
Compare the performance metrics of the algorithms.
Identify the best-performing model for flight delay prediction.
